        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "      * The paper explores the concept of data tidying, which is when data is restructured to make analysis easier. \n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "      * The tidy data standard has two goals: simplify data cleaning and to facilitate data analysis and tool development. Having a standard makes it easier to clean data because people don't have to \"reinvent the wheel\" each time and can save brainpower.\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "      * The first sentence about families is referring to the Leo Tolstoy quote, and means that tidy datasets adhere to a standardized structure and format, which makes them similar and consistent in their organization. In contrast, messy datasets vary widely in terms of how they are structured and formatted. There are many ways to be a messy dataset (or an unhappy family) but not many ways to be tidy (or happy).\n",
        "      * The second sentence means that when you look at a specific dataset, it's often straightforward to identify what makes up individual data points (observations) and what represents the characteristics being measured (variables). However, when attempting to create a general, abstract definition that applies to all datasets, it becomes challenging because the concept of what makes a variable and an observation can change based on the context and dataset.\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "      * Values, according to Wickham, are the individual data points in a dataset, and they can be either quantitative (numbers) or qualitative (strings). They represent measurements or attributes of interest.\n",
        "      * Variables are attributes or characteristics being measured or observed in a dataset. Variables group together all values that measure the same underlying attribute across different units or observations. \n",
        "      * Observations represent the individual units or entities being studied in a dataset. Each observation contains values measured on the same unit across various attributes or variables.\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "      * Tidy data is defined as a standardized way of structuring a dataset, aligning data's meaning with its structure:\n",
        "        - Each variable becomes a column.\n",
        "        - Each observation becomes a row.\n",
        "        - Each observational unit forms a separate table.\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "      * The 5 most common problems are:\n",
        "        - Column headers as values, not variable names\n",
        "        - Multiple variables stored in one column\n",
        "        - Variables stored in both rows and columns\n",
        "        - Multiple types of observational units stored in the same table\n",
        "        - A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables\n",
        "      * Table 4 is messy because it demonstrates the first problem, where column headers contain values instead of variable names. \n",
        "      * \"Melting\" a dataset refers to the process of transforming it from a wide format, where variables are represented as columns, into a long format, where values are stacked into rows. \n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "        * Table 11 is considered messy because it lacks the structured organization required for efficient data analysis, while Table 12 is tidy and \"molten\" because it has been transformed into a format that conforms to the principles of tidy data, making it more suitable for analysis and interpretation.\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "       * The \"chicken-and-egg\" issue in data wrangling is where the structure of data (tidy data) and the tools used for analysis (tidy tools) are interdependent. Tidy data is most beneficial when used with compatible tools, creating a challenge of mutual reliance. This situation can limit progress, as advancements in data analysis may be constrained by existing data structures and tools.\n",
        "      * Wickham anticipates future improvements in data wrangling, both incrementally and through exploring alternative data structuring methods. He emphasizes the importance of considering human factors and user-centered design in tool development and envisions the tidy data framework evolving as more research is conducted in this area."
